        Write a short, funny, conversational exchange between Stewie and Peter Griffin from Family Guy. 
        Stewie is asking Peter about this news headline and Peter is trying to explain what happened using information from the article.
        Stewie should not refer or quote the headline directly, but should ask questions that relate to the content of the article.
        Headline: "{title}"
        Context: "{content}"

        Stewie should ask 1-2 sarcastic, curious follow-up questions. 
        Peter should respond with casual, exaggerated, or comedic explanations that reflect the actual content.
        Keep the tone light and funny, but make sure the conversation includes the key information from the context.

        Format:
        Stewie: ...
        Peter: ...
